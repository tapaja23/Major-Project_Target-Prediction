# Target Customer Prediction Using Logistic Regression

The project's primary goal is to identify and forecast target customers based on a variety of factors, such as demographics, family history, occupation, purchasing history, and total revenue generated from them. In the model, Logistic Regression was used to predict the target customers (The target customers were categorized into two main broad categories: 0 and 1, where 0 represents the customers who are not the target customers based on total profit values made from them, and 1 represents the potential highly profitable customers). The profit made by the company to each customer and the probability value of being a target customer were the key parameters for developing the model, and the areas of uniqueness and innovations of this research.
